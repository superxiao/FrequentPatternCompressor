# FrequentPatternCompressor

This is an academic prototype of a compression algorithm using sampling and frequent pattern mining to efficiently compress comlumnar data.

This is the implementation for my Master's thesis:
[Efficiently compressing string columnar data using frequent pattern mining](http://summit.sfu.ca/item/16586#310)
